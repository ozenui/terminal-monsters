# Terminal Monsters ðŸ‘¾

A terminal-based game where you can collect, train, and battle monsters that live in your terminal!

Each monster in the dex is based off a specific programming language, framework, or technology, inspiring you to be curious and explore as many as possible to catch and train them all!

Work in progress. More details soon :)
